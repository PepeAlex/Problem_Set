import datetime
dt = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()

if dt == 1 or dt == 3:
        print("YES - today begins with a \"T\".")
else:
        print("NO - today not begin with a \"T\".")

# weekday is changed in numbers, so I created a statement that 
# corresponding numbers are printed following condition.
