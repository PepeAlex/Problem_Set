a = int(input("Please, enter a positive integer: "))

x = sum(range(0, (a + 1)))

print("""
The sum of the numbers is %d
Thank you
""" % x)    
# I tried to do something different and I used "sum" of the range for that.
# So I added "1" in that sum because if it is not my sum will not add the
# numbers that the user has chosen. I printed it differently because I can use 
# all possibilites of that.
